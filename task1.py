# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
# 1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
# 2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
# o	Addition
# o	Subtraction
# o	Multiplication
# o	Division
# 3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

a = float(input("enter first number: "))
b = float(input("enter second number: "))

print("Addition of two numbers is:", a+b)
print("Subtraction of numbers is:", a-b)
print("Multiplication of numbers is:", a*b)
print("Division of numbers is:", a/b)
